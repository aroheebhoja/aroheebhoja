Hi! I'm Arohee. I graduated from CMU in 2025 with a BS in Mathematical Sciences concentrating in Discrete Math and Logic.

My interests:
- Mathematical formalization and interactive theorem proving
- Combinatorial graph theory
- Theoretical computer science (especially computability theory, and its intersections with philosophy)
- Making art and [tattooing](ceruleanbluehue.github.io)
- Teaching!
