Hi! I'm Arohee (she/her), a senior at CMU majoring in Mathematical Sciences with a concentration in Discrete Math and Logic. 

My interests:
- Mathematical formalization and interactive theorem proving
- Combinatorial graph theory
- Theoretical computer science (especially computability theory, and its intersections with philosophy)
- Teaching!
